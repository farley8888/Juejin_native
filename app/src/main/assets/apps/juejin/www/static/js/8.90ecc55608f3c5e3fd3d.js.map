Execution in further ticks will be scheduled accordingly.\n *\n * If further execution requests have already been scheduled on the next tick, it can be checked with `hasNextTick`,\n * and cancelled with `clearNextTick`.\n *\n * The task can be scheduled as an interval repeatedly with a period as parameter (see `setInterval`, `clearInterval`).\n *\n * Sub-classes need to implement the `doTick` method which will effectively have the task execution routine.\n *\n * Further explanations:\n *\n * The baseclass has a `tick` method that will schedule the doTick call. It may be called synchroneously\n * only for a stack-depth of one. On re-entrant calls, sub-sequent calls are scheduled for next main loop ticks.\n *\n * When the task execution (`tick` method) is called in re-entrant way this is detected and\n * we are limiting the task execution per call stack to exactly one, but scheduling/post-poning further\n * task processing on the next main loop iteration (also known as \"next tick\" in the Node/JS runtime lingo).\n */\nvar TaskLoop = /** @class */ (function (_super) {\n    __extends(TaskLoop, _super);\n    function TaskLoop(hls) {\n        var events = [];\n        for (var _i = 1; _i < arguments.length; _i++) {\n            events[_i - 1] = arguments[_i];\n        }\n        var _this = _super.apply(this, [hls].concat(events)) || this;\n        _this._tickInterval = null;\n        _this._tickTimer = null;\n        _this._tickCallCount = 0;\n        _this._boundTick = _this.tick.bind(_this);\n        return _this;\n    }\n    /**\n     * @override\n     */\n    TaskLoop.prototype.onHandlerDestroying = function () {\n        // clear all timers before unregistering from event bus\n        this.clearNextTick();\n        this.clearInterval();\n    };\n    /**\n     * @returns {boolean}\n     */\n    TaskLoop.prototype.hasInterval = function () {\n        return !!this._tickInterval;\n    };\n    /**\n     * @returns {boolean}\n     */\n    TaskLoop.prototype.hasNextTick = function () {\n        return !!this._tickTimer;\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {number} millis Interval time (ms)\n     * @returns {boolean} True when interval has been scheduled, false when already scheduled (no effect)\n     */\n    TaskLoop.prototype.setInterval = function (millis) {\n        if (!this._tickInterval) {\n            this._tickInterval = setInterval(this._boundTick, millis);\n            return true;\n        }\n        return false;\n    };\n    /**\n     * @returns {boolean} True when interval was cleared, false when none was set (no effect)\n     */\n    TaskLoop.prototype.clearInterval = function () {\n        if (this._tickInterval) {\n            clearInterval(this._tickInterval);\n            this._tickInterval = null;\n            return true;\n        }\n        return false;\n    };\n    /**\n     * @returns {boolean} True when timeout was cleared, false when none was set (no effect)\n     */\n    TaskLoop.prototype.clearNextTick = function () {\n        if (this._tickTimer) {\n            clearTimeout(this._tickTimer);\n            this._tickTimer = null;\n            return true;\n        }\n        return false;\n    };\n    /**\n     * Will call the subclass doTick implementation in this main loop tick\n     * or in the next one (via setTimeout(,0)) in case it has already been called\n     * in this tick (in case this is a re-entrant call).\n     */\n    TaskLoop.prototype.tick = function () {\n        this._tickCallCount++;\n        if (this._tickCallCount === 1) {\n            this.doTick();\n            // re-entrant call to tick from previous doTick call stack\n            // -> schedule a call on the next main loop iteration to process this task processing request\n            if (this._tickCallCount > 1) {\n                // make sure only one timer exists at any time at max\n                this.clearNextTick();\n                this._tickTimer = setTimeout(this._boundTick, 0);\n            }\n            this._tickCallCount = 0;\n        }\n    };\n    /**\n     * For subclass to implement task logic\n     * @abstract\n     */\n    TaskLoop.prototype.doTick = function () { };\n    return TaskLoop;\n}(event_handler_1.default));\nexports.default = TaskLoop;\n\n\n/***/ }),\n\n/***/ \"./src/utils/attr-list.js\":\n/*!********************************!*\\\n  !*** ./src/utils/attr-list.js ***!\n  \\********************************/\n/*! no static exports found */\n/*!
